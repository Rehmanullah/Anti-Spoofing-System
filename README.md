# Anti-Spoofing-System
Image spoofing is a deceptive technique wherein individuals use manipulated images or videos to deceive biometric systems. This code uses HOG and CNN for face recognition, while YOLO 8 is for face detection.
We have combined Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), Linear Histogram of Gradient (HOG), and the You Only Look Once (YOLO 8) pre-trained model using a one-shot learning technique to avoid the lack of massive amount of training data and computational cost. The YOLO8 model is utilized for image spoofing detection, while CNN and HOG are employed for face detection and recognition. An automated system for face recognition and notification via WhatsApp is developed to demonstrate a face recognition-based security system. The unknown faces or attackers' images are sent to the administrator via WhatsApp. The administrator can store an image of an unidentified individual in the local MySQL database, accompanied by a label that serves as a reference point for later use, or they can implement preventive actions.
